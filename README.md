# Fetch Yahoo Data

A data management example. Although we're not installing any dependencies, it's 
good practice to use `virtualenv` when using python. 

```
# Set up virutalenv

virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

In order, to follow this example you'll need to have Postgresql installed as well
